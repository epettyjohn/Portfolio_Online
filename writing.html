          <p>INWAC is a non-profit alliance of local aerospace manufacturers that focuses on bringing aerospace commerce to the Inland Northwest, while acting as a liaison between small manufacturers and large aerospace companies. INWAC has recently altered their mission and membership requirements. I wrote a letter to those attending the Inland AM Expo* to confirm location, time, date, and reasons that those considering attending should attend.  </p>

            <p>SNAP’s Living Green program focuses on providing environmentally friendly living options to low income people in the Spokane area. The goal of the Living Green program is to decrease cost of living for low income families while creating a positive impact on the environment. SNAP sought teams to conduct research, locate eligible grants, and apply for these grants. I acted as team leader for this project and delegated tasks to each team member. The team applied to the Washington Foundation for the Environment to fund a portion of the Living Green program. The Washington Foundation for the Environment accepted the team’s grant proposal for the amount of $2000.00.</p>

            <p>INWAC is a non-profit alliance of local aerospace manufacturers that focuses on bringing aerospace commerce to the Inland Northwest, while acting as a liaison between small manufacturers and large aerospace companies. INWAC has recently altered their mission and membership requirements. Because of this, INWAC requested a feature story for print and online news sources that highlighted the upcoming Inland AM* Expo that INWAC is sponsoring. The intent of the article was to increase awareness about INWAC’s revised mission as well as the Inland AM* Expo and its impact on the Spokane area.  </p>

          <h2>Instructions After</h2>

            <p>Kaiser Aluminum is an aluminum manufacturing plant located in the Spokane area. Kaiser Aluminum uses instruction manuals to tell employees how to use and repair the machines in the plant. Kaiser Aluminum asked that a set of instructions be rewritten and reformatted to increase efficiency, be easily read and understood, and to have clear warnings about dangerous tasks. I began this project with a visit to the Kaiser Aluminum plant to assess lighting levels, employee uniforms, and access to computer programs. After visiting the plant I began editing the layout of the existing instructions for readability, especially in low-light situations. I created a clear and cohesive warning system that adheres to OSHA guidelines. Overall, the instruction writing process concluded with a complete set of instructions that is easy to read, labelled for warnings, and limits confusion. </p>

            <p>This is a research paper entitled “Natural Grammar vs. Prescriptive Grammar in Technical Writing” that explores the benefits and disadvantages of “natural” grammar and prescriptive grammar in technical writing. This paper uses peer reviewed research articles to suggest that “natural” grammar is useful in technical writing for specific audiences. A challenge that I faced while writing this paper was finding pertinent research to types of grammar and their affect in technical writing. To combat this challenge I used other databases to find research that pertained to my topic. Overall, this paper clearly illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of grammar in technical writing.</p>
