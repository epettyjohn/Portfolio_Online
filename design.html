            <p>The Designer Zine is a zine that showcases two influential graphic designers. The two designers that I chose to highlight are Milton Glaser and Erik Nitsche. Each section showcases a portion of the designer’s body of work and embodies their personal aesthetic. A challenge that I faced while creating this project was finding fonts that conveyed the same tone as the artist’s work. Overall, this piece is a straightforward showcase of two famous graphic designers.</p>

              <p>WOC Connections is a program that was recently launched at the YWCA of Spokane. The program seeks to pair women in the community with participants at the YWCA of Spokane to foster a mentoring relationship. The program requested a simple logo that embodied professionalism and the branding of the program. I followed the style guide for the program as well as the style guide for the YWCA and I created several good options for the program. </p>

        <p>I redesigned the logo for modcloth.com, as well as to create a business card for the organization. For this project I chose to continue using their icon and primary color, because these are strong portions of the website’s branding. However, I chose to add a secondary color, and change the font used in the logo. The purpose of this exercise was to improve an already successful brand. Overall, this project was successful in rebranding an existing, successful company without compromising the integrity of their brand. </p>
